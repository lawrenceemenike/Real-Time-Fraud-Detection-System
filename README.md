# Real-Time-Fraud-Detection-System

## Project Overview
This project involves developing a real-time fraud detection system using stream processing and anomaly detection techniques. The goal is to identify fraudulent transactions as they occur, leveraging Apache Kafka for streaming data ingestion and Apache Spark for real-time processing.

## Dataset
**Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset**
- **Description**: Contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. The dataset includes 284,807 transactions, with 492 frauds.
- **Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Project Scope and Objectives

### Define the Goals of the Fraud Detection System
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust, real-time fraud detection system capable of identifying fraudulent transactions with high accuracy and minimal latency. The system will leverage stream processing and anomaly detection techniques to process incoming transactions and flag potential frauds immediately.

#### Key Goals:
1. **Real-Time Detection**: The system should be able to process and analyze transactions in real-time, ensuring minimal delay between transaction occurrence and fraud detection.
2. **High Accuracy**: The model should accurately identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and false negatives.
3. **Scalability**: The system should be scalable to handle high transaction volumes without performance degradation.
4. **Explainability**: The system should provide explanations for flagged transactions to facilitate further investigation and verification.
5. **Robustness**: The model should be robust against different types of fraud and adaptable to evolving fraud tactics.

### Identify Key Performance Metrics
To evaluate the performance of the fraud detection system, the following metrics will be used:

1. **Accuracy**: Measures the overall correctness of the model, i.e., the proportion of true results (both true positives and true negatives) among the total number of cases examined.
   \[
   \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{TP} + \text{TN}}{\text{TP} + \text{TN} + \text{FP} + \text{FN}}
   \]
   
2. **Precision**: Indicates the proportion of positive identifications that are actually correct, i.e., how many of the transactions flagged as fraud are truly fraudulent.
   \[
   \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FP}}
   \]
   
3. **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Measures the proportion of actual frauds that are correctly identified, i.e., how many of the actual fraudulent transactions were detected by the model.
   \[
   \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{TP}}{\text{TP} + \text{FN}}
   \]
   
4. **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both concerns.
   \[
   \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
   \]
   
5. **ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**: Represents the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate across different thresholds. A higher AUC indicates a better performing model.
   \[
   \text{AUC} = \int_0^1 \text{TPR}(FPR) \, dFPR
   \]

6. **Latency**: Measures the time taken for the system to process a transaction and flag it as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. This metric is crucial for real-time systems to ensure timely detection and response.

### Summary of Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the model.
- **Precision**: Proportion of identified frauds that are truly fraudulent.
- **Recall (Sensitivity)**: Proportion of actual frauds detected.
- **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- **ROC-AUC**: Trade-off between true positive and false positive rates.
- **Latency**: Time taken to process and flag transactions in real-time.

### Project Scope:
